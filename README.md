# Markdown OCAML Syntax Highlighting in Sublime Text

This is a fork of [sublime-markdown-extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended). 
The only change I made was to add OCAML syntax highlighting within fenced code blocks. It's pretty rad.

## Installation

Go to `Preferences -> Browse Packages`, and then either download and unzip this plugin into that directory, or:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/sitarharel/sublime-markdown-extended.git "sublime-markdown-extended"
```

#### Activate the language
**After installing this package**, open a markdown file and switch the language to `Markdown Extended`, using one
of the following methods:

* Select from the list of supported languages in your status bar at the bottom right corner of your editor
* `ctrl + shift + p` and search for "Markdown Extended"

#### Make "Markdown Extended" the default
To make `Markdown Extended` the default highlighting for the current extension:

1. Open a file with the extension you want to set a default for (i.e. `.md`)
2. Navigate through the following menus in Sublime Text: `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Markdown Extended`
